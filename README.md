# When should you book Airbnbs in Seattle? 
A data-driven approach using Airbnb's 2016-2017 Seattle data.

## Introduction 
Seattle is one of Airbnb's most popular destinations in the west coast of the United States. Before booking this popular site, you might want to equip yourself with more knowledge to get the best deal. 

To help you score housing at the best prices, I used Airbnb data contaning 1393570 data points on Seattle availibilites, prices, and dates. 

Here are the three main questions we'll be exploring: 
1. *Are there more availabilities in some months relative to others?*
2. *What month is it cheapest to book in Seattle?*
3. *What day of the week do you get the best deal?*

## Conclusion 

In this article, we looked at 2016/17 Seattle Airbnb data. We cleaned the data and showed that:


> 1. There are fewer availiable houses in Janurary and July.
> 2. The summer months are much more expensive to book relative to wnter months.
> 3. Booknig near the weekend is much more expensive than bookng in the middle of the week.
